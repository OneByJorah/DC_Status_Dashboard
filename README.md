## 📦 What This Repository Contains

✅ Flask-based dashboard (mock data only)  
✅ Clean, responsive UI designed for operational readability  
✅ Admin dashboard + public read-only status page  
✅ Modular structure prepared for future expansion  

---

## 🔒 What This Repository Does NOT Contain

❌ Credentials  
❌ Domain names  
❌ Secrets  
❌ Production monitoring logic (yet)

This ensures the project is safe to **clone, review, fork, and contribute to publicly**.

## 🎓 Project Background & Motivation

This project was started in response to **real-world operational challenges** encountered in a **K-12 IT environment**.

Many enterprise monitoring solutions impose strict limitations on their free or entry-level tiers, including:

- 🔢 Device or node count caps  
- 🚫 Feature restrictions  
- 🕒 Limited data retention  
- 💰 Rapidly escalating licensing costs as environments grow  

In environments with **constrained budgets** and a large number of **mission-critical systems** — such as Domain Controllers, DNS, DHCP, and authentication services — these limitations can significantly reduce **visibility and operational awareness**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

This dashboard was created to:

- 🔍 Provide **unrestricted visibility** into critical Active Directory services  
- 🧩 Eliminate artificial limitations imposed by vendor licensing models  
- ⚙️ Enable full customization based on real operational requirements  
- 🌐 Support transparency through a public, read-only service status page  
- 🛠️ Serve as a practical monitoring solution built by an administrator **actively responsible** for these systems  

Beyond addressing an immediate operational need, this project also represents:

- 📚 A hands-on learning initiative driven by real infrastructure challenges  
- 🔁 A continuously evolving professional toolset  
- 💡 A demonstration of proactive problem-solving in constrained environments  

The project is intentionally **open, modular, and extensible**, allowing for future expansion, customization, and community contribution.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (Planned Phases)

1️⃣ PowerShell-based collector agents running on Domain Controllers  
2️⃣ Secure API ingestion and data persistence  
3️⃣ Authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)  
4️⃣ Alerting integrations (Email, Microsoft Teams)  
5️⃣ Historical uptime tracking and visualization

## 🚧 Project Status

🧪 This repository currently contains **mock data only** and serves as the **public foundation** of the project.

🔜 Production data collection, authentication, and alerting will be introduced in future phases.
